# RISC OS Open Instiki wiki fork

This is a Ruby On Rails 7+ fork of Instiki, providing wiki facilities. For some historical context, please see:

* https://github.com/parasew/instiki
* https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/wiki/instiki

The application was built by starting with a new Rails 7 application shell, then copying over and modifying files from the original Instiki code. This rewrite is specifically focused on the [RISC OS Open (ROOL)](https://www.riscosopen.org/) web site's use of Instiki, primarily on what ROOL refer to as the Epsilon server (or later).

The ROOL fork is based on whatever version was in use by ROOL on the old web site at the time the fork was constructed. There were many later additions to the original software that were not merged into to the old ROOL code base and are not present here either.
